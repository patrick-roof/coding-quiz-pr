# Coding Quiz App - Patrick Ruf

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a quiz application using Javascript, HTML and CSS. It will be multiple choice, and have a highscore screen and timer. The page will tell the user if they answered correctly or incorrectly, and will subtract from the timer if a question is answered incorrectly. The time left at the end will be the users score, which they can save locally.
